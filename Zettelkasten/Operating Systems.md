# What is an Operating System?
### What is a Kernel?
- Software component that's responsible for managing low-level features of the computer such as:
	- interfacing with hardware devices (network adapters, hard disks, ...)
	- allocating memory to individual programs
	- allocating CPU time to individual programs
	- enabling programs to interact with each other
- aka the "Software Glue" that holds the computer together
- Kernels are not interchangeable (Mac OS kernel != Windows Kernel)
- Many programs run on multiple kernels, but most need OS-specific tweaks. Programmers create [[binaries]]  - the program files for a particular processor and kernel - for each OS. 
### Command-line Shells
- In Linux, a shell known as the Bourne Again Shell (bash or Bash) is popular.
### Graphical User Interfaces
- Linux relies on a GUI known as the X Window System ("X").
- It also uses [[desktop environment]] program suites such as the GNU Object Model Environment (GNOME) or the K Desktop Environment (KDE), to provide a more complete user experience.
