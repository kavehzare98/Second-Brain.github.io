I'd like to start on a little side project where I can use this utility to track my finances in order to make better decisions.

Feature List:
- Have an app interface
- Connects with banking API to access my transaction data
- Scraping tool for bank statements
- Classification Algorithm (maybe LLM-based) which will automate transaction groupings
- Setting up an alert system that pushes notifications/ emails, notifying me how much I have allocated for the month

Most Lean Model:
- Command Line Interface
- Take input for manual entries
	- Amount
	- Deposit/ Withdrawal
	- Category (menu-based)
- First version should be procedural with only functions/ loops/ variables
- Second version should integrate OOP and Linked Lists, maps/dictionaries, frequency lists, numpy
- Write code in both Python and C++
